# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ABOUT THESE TESTS
#
# The tests below that use verify() and verify_all() use ApprovalTests.Python
# to write out some output (called "received") and compare it with
# previously-accepted output (called "approved").
#
# If the received differs from the approved, or if the approved does not
# exist yet, then the framework searches for a diff-tool on your machine,
# and uses it to show you the differences - with:
# - received on the left
# - approved on the right
#
# You can then either:
# 1. Fix the code, if the differences show an unwanted change
# 2. Use the diff tool to copy the changes over from received to approved,
#    if the changes are intentional.
#
# Reference material:
# 1. Clare's talks on Approval Tests:
#       - https://claremacrae.co.uk/conferences/presentations_by_topic.html#testing-legacy-c-code-with-approval-tests
#       - The start of the 2019-02-05 video is probably the best introduction.
# 2. Python ApprovalTests library:
#       - https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Python
