# Scripts for Maintenance

We use Python scripts to machine-generate some of the content of the Hub.

- Scripts location: [.github/scripts](https://github.com/obsidian-community/obsidian-hub/tree/main/.github/scripts)
- For `update-releases.py`, see [[Updating Extensions]]
- For `update-mocs.py`, see [[Updating MOC files]]
    - If modifying that script, see also [[Testing Python Code with Approval Tests]]
