![[README]]


We think of this vault as a [[Digital garden]]. This means that the content in our vault is very much a work in progress. Since we're at a very early stage, there's a lot of space to grow! You can check out a few sample notes were we already have some content:

- [[02.02 - Categories|Plugin categories]].
- [[How to Style Obsidian]]
- [[YT - How to use QuickAdd|How to use QuickAdd]]

You can also take a look at the (auto-generated) index for our vault:

![[community-vault#MOC]]
