### Integrations with Anki
- [[obsidian-to-anki-plugin|Obsidian to Anki]] enables you to create [[Anki]] flashcards from a text or markdown file. It lets you define specific deck names and tags for every folder in your vault. Not currently in active development, but a fully featured plugin with a nice wiki.
- [[ObsidianAnkiSync|Obsidian Anki Sync]] is similar to Obsidian to Anki but uses a different and more powerful markup based syntax for making flash cards.
- [[flashcards-obsidian|Flashcards]] also integrates with Anki, and has a nice wiki. Flashcards is slightly less customizable and only allows for the addition of one note's worth of cards at a time.
- [[obsidian-ankibridge|AnkiBridge]] started as a fork of Flashcards but diverged and now has a bunch of other features worth checking out.

### Other exporters
- [[mochi-cards-exporter|Mochi Cards Exporter]] exports markdown notes to [Mochi flashcards](). Cards are designated via tags.
