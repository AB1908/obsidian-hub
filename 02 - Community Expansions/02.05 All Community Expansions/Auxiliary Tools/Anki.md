Anki is a free and open-source [[🗂️ Auxiliary Tools|tool]] to create digital flashcards. It uses a [[Spaced repetition]] algorithm to help you prevent forgetting what you have learned. It lets you review information over a long period of time as revisions are spaced out based on your confidence to recall the learned content.

There are several community-developed plugins to integrate Obsidian into an Anki workflow. See: [[Spaced Repetition Plugins]]
