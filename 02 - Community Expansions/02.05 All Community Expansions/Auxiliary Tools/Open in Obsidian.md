# Open in Obsidian

Official website: https://rebrand.ly/SaveToObsidian
Cost: Free
Available for: [[iOS Apps|iOS]], [[iPadOS Apps|iPadOS]], [[MacOS Tools|MacOS]]

“Open in Obsidian” is an iOS/iPadOS/MacOS [[iOS Shortcuts|Shortcut]] which takes input from the Share menu and imports it into the Obsidian app.

To download: Visit the “official website” linked above, and tap the “Get Shortcut” button. The Shortcuts app will open and offer to import the shortcut (if nothing happens after Shortcuts opens, go back and tap “Get Shortcut” again).

To use: In the Share menu (<img src="https://help.apple.com/assets/61800C7E6EA4632586448084/61800C896EA463258644809A/en_US/01f5a9889bbecc202d8cbb3067a261ad.png" alt="" height="30" width="23" originalImageName="GlobalArt/IL_Share.png">) or “Share…” item in the [edit menu](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/controls/edit-menus/), select “Save to Obsidian,” and the content should then magically appear in Obsidian.

In principle, it will accept any input. In practice, some formats will work better than others. 

If you run into formats it handles poorly, or any other problems, please leave feedback on the [shortcut website](https://rebrand.ly/SaveToObsidian) or on <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@calion%20Re%20Save%20to%20Obsidian%3A">Twitter</a>.
