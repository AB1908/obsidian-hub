Looking for the perfect TTRPG Campaign Manager? Look no further.

Obsidian.md is free and has a whole heap of plugins that are designed to turn this simple note taking tool into a Campaign Manager that offers the same functionality as other common tools such as Realm Works, World Anvil, etc. 

## Patreon - Tutorial and Resource List
Patreon is where I share my content. If you are looking for video tutorials or the resources I talk about in my videos (such as the [Plugin List](https://www.patreon.com/posts/59873493) or [Templates](https://www.patreon.com/posts/59509023)); then this is where I post them.
