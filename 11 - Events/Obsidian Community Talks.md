# Obsidian Community Talks

%% Add a description below this line. It doesn't need to be long: one or two sentences should be a good start. %%

This is an evergreen version of the [community talks forum post](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/meta-community-talks/16686)

## What are community talks?

Obsidian Community Talks are **community-organised** presentations given **by** Obsidian users. Anyone is welcome to offer to **give** a presentation, and you can also *request* a talk. The **topic** of the presentations can be a professional *or* personal interest, linking to how Obsidian helps you in the process. The **format** can vary as you wish; one could have a collaborative project where the audience participates in solving a problem, for example. Have fun with it!

## Get involved

For anyone interested in “Obsidian Talks”, we have created two Google forms:

* One you can use to offer to [**give a talk**](https://forms.gle/LvcLKisHt9qzFiKM7) on a topic, and

* One where you can [**request a topic**](https://forms.gle/8EL5SFyhw4ExKHPeA) to be spoken on by *someone else*.

Please feel free to complete either of the forms if you wish to get involved! The forms don’t collect email addresses, so only the information you decide to share will be captured.

You can then go over to this thread to vote for the talks you're interested in: https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-talks-which-talks-do-you-want-to-hear/15705
