Been thinking about making a plugin or theme but never had the opportunity to do it? October is the time!

Obsidian October is an official event brought to you by Obsidian to help you get started with making your very own plugins and themes.

## How it works

Starting now, we'll start accepting participants (abbreviated as OOers below). Anyone can participate! You'll get a special role to indicate you're participating too.

You can apply any time before October 31, but we encourage you to start early so you have a higher chance to finish your project.

There will be a special channel on Discord to ask questions and chat about your progress. On the forum, we'll also have mega post for the event for people to share their daily progress and learnings. Developers who help out will also receive a special mentor role!

## Submitting your project

Any OOer who finishes their project before October 31, 2021 can submit their repo (how to submit is TBD). You can include a mentor in your submission to show appreciation. This list of submissions will be showcased on the website.

You can also choose to submit your plugin to our official community plugin directory by [making a pull request to this list](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/blob/master/community-plugins.json) if you're satisfied with your plugin.

OOers can optionally fill out a short survey to let us know how was the experience and how can we improve.

## Prizes

After October 31, 2021, the participant role will be removed and those who submitted a project will get a souvenir role for "Completed OO 2021".

The winning submissions will also be highlighted on our websites and remain accessible & visible.

The awards are as following:
