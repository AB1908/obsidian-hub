## Event goal

Abbreviated as OO, Obsidian October is an official event that ~~makes Licat question why he cannot ever leave GitHub code review page during October~~ encourages users who have interests in making plugins and themes but haven't had the time and guidance to tinker with them.

## Event 

The event, as the name suggests, spans the entire October. We will announce the event around September 20 to get people signed up as participants, mentors, or judges.

Anyone can be a participant; for mentors and judges we'll do some filtering. If you're a judge, you cannot be a mentor due to potential conflict of interest, but you can stick around our special channel to help. If you're a mentor, you cannot be a participant.

Participants will receive a special role (Carl reaction role) on Discord. They can choose to reach out to a mentor on Discord or forum to describe what they want to accomplish, or they can choose to be mentored by the community as a whole.

We will have a dedicated channel on Discord and subcategory on the forum. They will be locked and archived until the next OO.

## Submission

Any participant who finishes their project at hand can submit their repo to a special Git repo (or a new JSON file in the existing `obsidian-releases` repo, e.g. `obsidian-october-2021.json`). They'll be asked to include the name of their mentor if they have one. This list of submissions will be showcased on the website.

Alternatively, participants can do this through Google Form. That way we can get more feedback on what they learned and what they like the most and the least bout the event. We can export the data into JSON to display on our website.

## Prizes

After the event end date, all participant roles will be removed and those who submitted a project will get a souvenir role for "Completed OO 2021".

The judges will decide 1 winner project and 3 runner-ups for both the plugin category and theme category.

Winners receive a custom made trophy; runner-ups will receive $100 Obsidian credit that can be used towards any Obsidian license or service (non-transferable).

The winning submissions will also be highlighted on our websites and remain accessible & visible as long as our website is still accessible.

## Behind the scenes

We need to start recruiting mentors soon. We'll have a Google Form to collect their Discord handles, past work, and their specialty.

We'll hand pick the judges; we don't need too many, 3 or 5 is plenty.

Adding reaction roles, channels, and forum categories should be pretty straightforward after we have a list of mentor candidates and reached out the judges. This needs to be completed by the time we announce the event.
